# 🌐 The FreeWeb

The FreeWeb is an open-source project to build a resilient, decentralized, and community-owned meshnet using low-cost, solar-powered devices. Each node runs on an ESP32 with LoRa, Bluetooth, and optional Wi-Fi, and connects with other nodes to provide free internet access in areas where it’s needed most.

Nodes communicate over long-range LoRa in a mesh configuration, with select nodes acting as Wi-Fi access points when connected to public or donor networks. Designed to be modular, energy-efficient, and secure, The FreeWeb can scale from small neighborhoods to entire cities — all without relying on traditional ISPs.
